Description: Functions and code to simulate metapopulation genetics. Includes genetic drift, mutation, selection and migration. The metapopulation has age-structure. Migration is limited to the first age class (like seeds in plants and larvae in marine organisms). The model can handle very large numbers of individuals and simulations are very fast. Version 2.0 allow for multilocus simulations.
