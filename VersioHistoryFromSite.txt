0.0.6 2016 December
 - fixed a few mistakes in the manual files
 - various minor adjustments (following La Paz's class)
 - Using constant dispersal matrices is more memory-efficient
0.0.5 2016 June
 - added functions to calculate Weir&Cockerham's theta estimator of FST
 - added a funciton to simulate coral genetics (one stage class)
0.0.4, 2015 November 30th
 - solved an issue that caused an error when using large fecundities
0.0.3, 2015 July 13th
 - corrected a bug in fecundity calculation that led to underestimation of fecundity
0.0.2, 2015 January 8th
 - added stochastic fecundity: now fecundity is modeled as a Poisson process
0.0.1, 2014 November 26th
- included number of years of simulations (T_max) as an explicit argument to the function and not as a parameter calculated from the size of the demographic parameters. This allows for the following option...
- ....option to define time-invariant demographic parameters without having to multiplicate the same array for all years of simulations
- included the argument save.res.T that defines the time steps for which results are saved, when they are saved on disk (save.res = T)
